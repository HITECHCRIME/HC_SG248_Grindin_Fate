## Lyrics

```
i've been blinding fate
i did gone insane
imma say buy into phase erased

grinding fate
i've been grinding fate
imma say this in place of misery

grinding fate
i've been griding fate
imma bite buy into phase erased

grinding fate
place on a razor
right the wrong

i've been - grinding - fate
i've gone insane
bite on the nails but got still erased

grinding fate
i've been grinding fate
imma say buy into phase erased

well grinding fate
i've been grinding fate
fucking rage

say it all outright\

gone to filling in our points - say no wrong
i've been dealing with these fuckers till i did it right
it's been way out ducking just don't say to praise the wrong
i've been deader than a corpse in a coffin dealt

how to say it i've been ready since revival
hover till i can leave it all and lay it down
i've been grinding my eyes 
it's the misery

misery
i've been grinding
free the rebels
set their souls


i can't say what's been done
```
