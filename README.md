## Lyrics

```
i've been blinding fate i did gone insane imma say buy into phase erased
grinding fate i've been grinding fate imma say this in place of misery
grinding fate i've been griding fate imma bite into phase erased
grinding fate place on a razor right the wrong

i've been - grinding - fate, i've gone insane bite on the nails but got still erased
grinding fate i've been grinding fate in this place of misery
well grinding fate i've been grinding fate fucking rage
say it all outright ya gotcha, let it out ya

gone to filling outin our points - say no wrong
i've been dealing with these fuckers till i did it right
it's been way out ducking just don't say to praise the wrong
i've been deader than a corpse in coffin dealt the hand

eyyy how to say it i've been ready since revival
hover till i can leave it all out and lay it down
i've been grinding my - heart out i'm phasing out
i can't say what's been done to my heart

i've been grinding free ready for my own road                               / take down
i've been grinding free the rebels all i want is souls
i've been grinding free forever wanna set their souls / wanna eat my soul
i've been grinding free for reapin wanna finish all
